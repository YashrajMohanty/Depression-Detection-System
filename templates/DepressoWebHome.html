                        Depression is a common and serious medical illness
                        that negatively affects how you feel, the way you
                        think and how you act. Depression causes feelings
                        of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities
                        you once enjoyed.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        It can lead to a variety of emotional
                        and physical problems and can decrease your ability to
                        function at work and at home. Other symptoms may include
                        changes in appetite and weight, sleep disturbances, fatigue,
                        difficulty concentrating, feelings of guilt or worthlessness
                        and more.

                        Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence in
                        computer science which makes use of data algorithms
                        to emulate human learning, gradually bettering it's accuracy
                        and efficiency. Machine learning has the potential to play a
                        significant role in improving mental health care in several ways:

                            <li>Personalized treatment plans</li>
                            <li>Predictive analytics</li>

                        Depression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any
                        given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience
                        depression at some time in their life. Depression can occur at
                        any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens
                        to mid-20s.

                        Being sad is not the same as having depression. Both grief and
                        depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual
                        activities. Grief and depression can co-exist. When grief and
                        depression co-occur, the grief is more severe and lasts longer
                        than grief without depression.

                        Fortunately, depression is a treatable condition. While it can be a
                        challenging and sometimes chronic illness, the majority of people
                        with depression can find relief and improve their quality of life
                        with appropriate treatment. Between 80% and 90% percent of people
                        with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all
                        patients gain some relief from their symptoms.
